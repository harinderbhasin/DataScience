# Introduction
This R markdown gives the code and output for three exercises from the week 1 live session.

# Specifications
  * Exercise 1: Calculate log and square-root
  * Exercise 2: Create a vector of 15 standard normal random variables and calculate its mean and SD
  * Exercise 3: Use the values of given two vectors and calculate the scatterplot, BMI, and mean of the weight.
```{r}
# the log of a positive number (x)
log(10)

# the default base of a log function is e (natural log)
log10(10)

# calculate log of previous number with different base with b being the base,
log(10, base = 3)

# log of a negative number is undefined because if y=logb(x) log(-10)

# x = b^y and since b is a positive number, x must be positive square-root of a positive number
sqrt(16)

# create a vector of 15 standard normal random variables
vector1 <- rnorm(15)

# calculate its mean
mean(vector1)

# calculate its SD
sd(vector1)

# change the mean to 10 and the SD to 2 and recalculate the vector of
# 15 random variables. calculate its mean and SD
vector1 <- rnorm(15, mean = 10, sd = 2)
mean(vector1)
sd(vector1)

# the means and sd are not exactly the same as specified because
# (?????)

# given two vectors
weight <- c(60, 72, 57, 90, 95, 72)
height <- c(1.80, 1.85, 1.72, 1.90, 1.74, 1.91)

# create a scatterplot
plot(height, weight, xlab = "Height", ylab = "Weight")

# calculate BMI
BMI <- weight / (height * height)

# calculate weight mean
mean(weight)

# subtract mean from each value of weight
weight - mean(weight)

# sum the result
sum (weight - mean(weight))
```
